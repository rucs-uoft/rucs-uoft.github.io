    <p>
        The Review of Undergraduate Computer Science (RUCS) is a non-archival
        publication based at the University of Toronto that features the best of
        research work conducted by undergraduate students.  RUCS only publishes
        extended abstracts (650 – 1050 words).  If you are interested in submitting,
         please read the following and send any questions to
         <a href="mailto:julia@cs.toronto.edu">julia@cs.toronto.edu</a>.
             The deadline for submissions is May 10, 2016.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are interested in making a submission, please be sure to
        download and fill out the <a href="assets/supervisor-form.docx">Supervisor
        Approval Form.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        We've prepared a template <a href="assets/rucs-template.tex">latex file</a> and
        a template <a href="assets/bib_template.bib">bib file</a> for your
        submissions. 
    </p>

    <h3>Who can make a submission?</h3>

    <p>
        CSC494/CSC495 students from the 2015-2016 academic year are strongly
        encouraged to submit, even if your project focuses more on development
        than research.  If you do not fall into this category but have worked in
        a research setting, you may still be eligible; please contact
         <a href="mailto:julia@cs.toronto.edu">julia@cs.toronto.edu</a>.
         for more information.
    </p>

    <h3>Why should you submit?</h3>

    <p>
        It is an opportunity for your work to get published and would look great
        on your resume! We also partnered with Google last year to organize an
        exclusive networking event for students selected to be published in RUCS,
        and we hope to organize a similar event this year. One published student
        from last year then went on to join Google in early 2016.
    </p>

    <h3>What criteria do submissions need to meet?</h3>

    <p>
        Your submission should be either a LaTeX source file (.tex with
        accompanying references in a .bib file) or a Word document (.docx, .doc)
        containing an extended abstract that is 650 – 1050 words in length
        (excluding the title, section headings, and citations); LaTeX is strongly
         preferred. The extended abstract should summarize the work you have done
         and should be accessible to students unfamiliar with your specific field
         of research.
         Please read the template, the
         <a href="http://rucs.ca/assets/pdf/Extended_Abstract_Exemplar.pdf">
         exemplar</a>,
         the
          <a href="http://rucs.ca/assets/pdf/Best_Practices_Guide.pdf"> best practices guide</a>,
         and the instructions below to gain a better understanding of what
         is expected.
    </p>

    <h3>What is the submission process?</h3>

    <p>
        The RUCS review process is ‘internal’; in place of an external review board,
         it is expected that your supervising professor and graduate mentor
         (if applicable) will review your extended abstract for correctness and
         accuracy. Please follow these steps carefully:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Approach your supervisor and graduate mentor (if applicable)
            and express your interest in submitting to RUCS.  Only proceed if they agree.
        </li>
        <li>
            After reading all of the provided documents, prepare a first draft.
            Ask your graduate mentor or supervisor to help edit the initial drafts.
            Your supervising professor should review, at the very least, the final
            draft of your extended abstract.
        </li>
        <li>
            Email your submission to <a href="mailto:julia@cs.toronto.edu">julia@cs.toronto.edu</a>
            with the subject line “RUCS Extended Abstract Submission”.  Fill
            out the Supervisor Approval form and follow the submission
            instructions on the page. Both should be submitted by May 10, 2016.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="center">FAQs</h2>
    <ol>
        <li class="strong">
            What if my research is being published or has been published in a professional journal?
        </li>
        <p>
            Professional journals often prohibit publishing elsewhere.
            While RUCS does not aim to compete with these journals in any way,
            as a precaution, your supervisor may not want your abstract published.
            To get their explicit consent, and to verify that they have reviewed
            your submission, the Supervisor Approval form must be signed.
        </p>

        <li class="strong">
            Do I retain all rights to my work?
        </li>

        <p>
            Yes, you retain all rights to your work.  RUCS is a non-archival
            publication that is simply granted a license to publish your work online.
        </p>

        <li class="strong">
            What happens if my submission does not meet all of the criteria?
        </li>

        <p>
            If your extended abstract does not conform to the RUCS guidelines, you
            will be contacted about making the necessary changes to your submission.
            Note that if your submission differs from the guidelines to a significant
            degree, it may be rejected; for this reason, please read the guidelines
            closely before submitting.
        </p>

        <li class="strong">
            If a substantial amount of research has been done but the project is
             not yet complete, is an extended abstract outlining preliminary
             results viable for publication?
        </li>
        <p>
            Yes; discuss with your supervisor what the focus of your extended
            abstract should be.  The structure of your abstract may need to be
            modified accordingly.
        </p>
