<h1 id="introduction">I. Motivation</h1>
<p>Automated planning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that concerns the generation of a set of actions and orderings – a plan – for execution by agents to realize a goal. While significant advances have been made in automated planning involving final-state goals, most real-world planning problems involve complex goals that are temporally extended, necessitate the optimization of preferences or other quality measures, require adherence to safety constraints and directives, and/or may require or benefit from following a prescribed high-level script that specifies how the task is to be realized. By way of illustration, consider a logistics company that transports packages. Package delivery may be governed by the following types of (possibly inconsistent) goals:
    <ul>
        <li>Always ship frozen food in a refrigerated truck.</li>
        <li>Prefer to deliver priority packages before regular packages.</li>
        <li>If the customer is a preferred customer, then always apply a 15% discount to the final bill.</li>
        <li>Prefer to deliver domestic packages within 24 hours of receipt.</li>
        <li>While a truck is at a location and not full, load all packages bound for a different destination on the truck; drive to the next destination; unload all packages to be delivered to this destination.</li>
    </ul>
Such goals are typically specified in the subset of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) found in the Planning Domain Description Language, PDDL3.0 [3].
</p>

<p>In a series of well-received lectures between 2011 and 2013, Moshe Vardi advocated convincingly for the benefits of LTL, but also discussed its limitations in the context of industry-driven verification tasks (e.g., [5]). In response to LTL’s limitations, Vardi advocated Linear Dynamic Logic (LDL)), a temporal logic that combines LTL and Regular Expressions (REs) in a manner that avoids the exponential increase in size that typically plagues REs in such a context. Subsequently, De Giacomo and Vardi [2], proposed LDLf, which defines LDL over finite traces, citing automated planning among the applications for the logic.</p>

<p>In brief, LDL is semantically a very powerful language that can serve as a goal specification vehicle for a myriad of applications in automated planning and beyond, ranging from business process management/monitoring and Internet of Things, to high-level robot control. However, we believe that despite the great mathematical power of LDL, its syntax is not very intuitive. To mend this, we propose LTL-RE: a language with a user-friendly syntax whose expressive power is no less than that of LDL. We also propose a means of efficiently planning with LTL-RE, and thus LDL, by exploiting highly optimized classical planning technology. The critical question of how to efficiently generate plans with goals specified in LDL (or LTL-RE) has not yet been explored in the literature.</p>

<h1 id="approach">II. Contributions</h1>
<p>We propose LTL-RE, a high-level language that supports the specification of a wide variety of temporal goals, not only using LTL but also using REs. LTL- RE derives its formal foundation from finite Linear Dynamic Logic (LDLf), and its expressive power is no less than that of regular expressions. LTL- RE augments LDLf with planning-friendly syntax including LTL and typical programming language constructs. It is also designed for use with AI automated planning transition systems, supporting state-, action-, and path-oriented temporal goal specification. Further, we propose a translation of LTL-RE goals into classical planning domains for use with state-of-the-art classical planners. Unlike previous reformulation approaches that exploited Non-deterministic Finite State Automata (NFAs) (e.g., [1]), we exploit an approach based on Alternating Automata following Torres and Baier [4] that avoids the worst-case exponential increase in size inherent to NFAs. We evaluated the behavior of our translator and the resultant planning problems, with comparison to alternative LTL translators.</p>

<h1 id="analysis">III. Analysis</h1>
<p>We have implemented the translator for LTL-RE. Since realistic benchmarks exist only in limited ways and only for the LTL fragment of LTL- RE, the comparative experimental analysis reported here is solely for the LTL fragment of LTL-RE.</p>

<p>We compared the performance of our LTL-RE translator both to a Non-Deterministic Finite state Automata (NFA)-based LTL translator initially introduced in [1], and to an Alternating Automata (AA)-based LTL translator [4], similar to ours. The NFA-based LTL translator is highly optimized to avoid, in most cases, the exponential increase in the size of the automata characteristic of NFA-based representations of LTL. The AA translator exists in two versions: a naive one without engineering optimizations, and an optimized version. In order to fairly compare against our LTL-RE translator, which currently lacks the implementation of analogous optimizations, we compared against the similarly unoptimized AA-based LTL translator. Even this comparison is not entirely appropriate. The LTL-RE translator is designed to translate all of LDLf, including REs, LTL, and additional programming language constructors. We expected that a special-purpose translator that is tuned exclusively to LTL would be more efficient than the LTL portion of a more general LTL-RE translator at least before implementation of optimizations.</p>
