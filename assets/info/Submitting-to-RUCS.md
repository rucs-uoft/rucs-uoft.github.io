# Submitting to RUCS 

The Review of Undergraduate Computer Science (RUCS) is a non-archival publication based at the University of Toronto that features the best of research work conducted by undergraduate students. RUCS only publishes extended abstracts (650 – 1050 words). 

If you are interested in submitting, please read the following and send any questions to [rucsuoft@gmail.com](mailto:rucsuoft@gmail.com). The deadline for submissions is **December 15, 2018**. 

## Who can make a submission? 

If you have done an undergraduate research project in computer science or an adjacent discipline, we encourage you to submit an extended abstract to RUCS. Adjacent disciplines include but are not limited to: cognitive science, computational biology, applied math, and software engineering. We only have a couple of requirements. Please consider submitting your extended abstract to RUCS if:

- you were an undergraduate student at the time the research project was completed,
- the research was completed less than 2 years ago, and 
 - you did your research in a supervised academic setting, e.g. for course credit or as part of a program such as UGSRP or UROP.

## Why should you submit? 

It is an opportunity for your work to get published and would look great on your resume! We are also hoping to offer some additional perks. In previous years, we have partnered with Google to organize an exclusive networking event for the students selected to be published in RUCS; we hope to organize a similar event this year. 

## What should you submit? 

Your submission should be a LaTeX source file (.tex with accompanying references in a .bib file) and a PDF generated from the LaTeX source. Your submission should contain an extended abstract that is 650 – 1050 words in length (excluding the title, section headings, and citations). You must also include a signed copy of the [supervisor approval form](http://rucs.ca/assets/info/Supervisor-Approval.pdf). 

#### Content 

The extended abstract should summarize the work you have done and should be accessible to students unfamiliar with your specific field of research. Please read the [exemplar](http://rucs.ca/assets/info/Extended-Abstract-Exemplar.pdf), the [best practices guide](http://rucs.ca/assets/info/RUCS-Best-Practices-Guide.pdf), and the instructions below to gain a better understanding of what is expected. 

#### Structure

While the structure of your extended abstract will strongly depend on the nature of your research, it is recommended you use the following form as a starting point: 

1. **Introduction**: What was the goal of your research? Why is it important? 
2. **Approach**: What methods and techniques did you use? Why were they appropriate? 
3. **Analysis**: How did your implementation fare? What were the major findings? 
4. **Conclusion**: What can you conclude? How does this fit into the ‘big picture’? Make sure your introduction provides enough background for your reader to understand the rest of the abstract.
5. **References**: Please use the IEEE Style for references. 

## What is the submission process? 

It is expected that your supervising professor and graduate mentor (if applicable) will review your extended abstract for correctness and accuracy.  Please follow these steps carefully:

1. Approach your supervisor and graduate mentor (if applicable) and express your interest in submitting to RUCS.  Only proceed if they agree.
2. After reading all of the provided documents, prepare a first draft.  Ask your graduate mentor or supervisor to help edit the initial drafts. Your supervising professor should review the final draft of your extended abstract.  
3. Fill in the [online submission form](https://forms.gle/k2R6oMkwvVefuuTEA) and attach a signed copy of the [supervisor approval form](http://rucs.ca/assets/info/Supervisor-Approval.pdf).  **The form should be submitted by December 15, 2018.**

You can expect a response from RUCS by mid-November. If your submission is accepted, editors will keep in touch throughout the revision process.

## FAQs 

##### What if my research is being published or has been published in a professional journal?

Professional journals often prohibit publishing elsewhere.  While RUCS does not aim to compete with these journals in any way, as a precaution, your supervisor may not want your abstract published. Please consult with your supervisor. 

##### Do I retain all rights to my work?

Yes, you retain all rights to your work.  RUCS is a non-archival publication that is simply granted a license to publish your work online.

##### What happens if my submission does not meet all of the criteria?

If your extended abstract does not conform to the RUCS guidelines, you will be contacted about making the necessary changes to your submission.  Note that if your submission differs from the guidelines to a significant degree, it may be rejected; for this reason*,* please read the guidelines closely before submitting.

##### If a substantial amount of research has been done but the project is not yet complete, is an extended abstract outlining preliminary results viable for publication?

Yes; discuss with your supervisor what the focus of your extended abstract should be.  The structure of your abstract may need to be modified accordingly. 

##### What if my project is more focused on development than research? 

You are still encouraged to submit. Email [rucsuoft@gmail.com](mailto:rucsuoft@gmail.com) if you have any questions about eligibility. 

##### How strict is the word count? 

The word count is intended to enforce the "extended abstract" format, as well as to encourage students to keep their topic focussed and their language concise. If your submission exceeds the word count, it will not be rejected outright. However, exceeding the word count can be a sign that your submission has bigger problems. 

##### When will the next issue be released? 

We do not have a set release date. Accepted authors will be kept in the loop via email.
