<p>Wow, what a year it has been! Although I could not isolate the performance and delivery of RUCS from the vicissitudes of my personal life, I am nonetheless proud at long last to present the final product to you, <em>dear reader, </em>replete with the quintessential commentary known as a <b>Letter from the Editor:</b></p>
<p>This year has been another successful incarnation of the RUCS journal, and I am happy to have expanded our journal&rsquo;s reach nationwide, with publications from <a href="/web-valuecharts-analyzing-individual-and-group-preferences-with-interactive-web-based-visualizations">UBC</a> and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/solving-pdes-on-deconstructed-domains-for-geometry-processing">MIT</a>. Additionally, we will be hosting an inaugural joint undergraduate research conference with TURCS (Toronto Undergraduate Research in Computer Science) this coming September. This can be found on our heavily-revamped website, which has undergone a redesign as part of my strategic vision to keep RUCS more active year-round.</p>
<p>To my excellent staff: Danya, Samir and Tyler, and Lynn, thank you so much for all the work you have done. Thank you very much to our faculty advisor Sam Toueg, as well as Kawin Ethayarajh and Julia Gilenko, our &ldquo;editor-in-chief emeriti&rdquo; whose hallowed company I will soon be eagerly joining. Together, their gestalt advice and experience has proved invaluable in managing the publication. We hope that RUCS continues to be a &ldquo;first-page&rdquo; result (our generation&rsquo;s &ldquo;household name&rdquo;) when it comes to undergraduate computer science research at U of T, in Canada, and around the world.</p>
<p>As I type in the final keystrokes of this letter, I bring to a close an important chapter in both my personal and RUCS&rsquo; life. Looking forward, I have great optimism that next year&rsquo;s editor will carry on RUCS&rsquo; burgeoning legacy and impact.</p>
<p>Standing on the shoulders of giants, I have no doubt that they will improve RUCS in ways that will keep you <em>dear reader</em> coming back to read <em>next year&rsquo;s </em>publication.</p>



<p> Thanks. <br/> <br/> John Chen <br/>
    <em>2017-2018 Editor-in-Chief</em>, <br/> RUCS
