<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>The 2018-2019 academic year has come to a close and so has an exciting chapter in the history of RUCS. We've had the pleasure of working on several really exciting new initiatives. We created the Undergraduate Research Guide and organized several events, including the Undergrad Research Info Session, the UGSRP Social, and the CS Research-A-Thon.</p>
<p>Although putting on events is not the primary mission of a publication, it was tremendously enjoyable and gave all of us a much-needed opportunity to get out of the house, interact with our peers, and have fun. Research is usually portrayed in books and movies as a solitary endeavour. However, in practice, it is often a deeply social activity, from the germination of new ideas, to the logisitics of disseminating findings and acquiring funding. </p>
<p>However, the year was not all fun and games. Our community experienced a tragic loss of life. This event has served to highlight the immense pressure that undergraduate students experience, and the dire need for mental health awareness and treatment options on our campuses. In light of this event, I'd like to dedicate this issue to the students who are no longer with us.</p>
<p> Thanks. <br/> <br/> Danya Lette <br/>
